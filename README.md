'Specialist Certificate in Data Analytics Essentials' Project
This is a binary classification machine learning project which evaluates the effectiveness of multiple algorithms predicting whether an email 
is 'spam' or 'not spam' ('ham'). 

The dataset consists of 58 columns of word and character frequency counts assigned to each email as feature 
variables. A class column with values of 0 and 1 is the target variable. 

The model's parameters are hypertuned. Various techniques such as boosting, stacking and ensembling is performed. Feature variables are 
created in an effort for dimension reduction in the dataset, but are not unlike the original dataset, are not used in further analysis. 
Descriptive and inferential statistics are used throughout the project to determine insights. 

The stacked classifiers can be loaded back into another file for further use on another dataset with data types and preprocessing to further
test this model.
